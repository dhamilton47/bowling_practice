## Practice Work

This repository contains practice work creating React components.  The projects are suggestions from [Dave Ceddia's blog](https://daveceddia.com/react-practice-projects/).

At this point the components are all classes or functions.  There are no hooks used.

#### Soda List

Simple input and button components used to generate a list.

#### Social Card

This project is more complex.  The implementation I have created breaks out each block of text or text/image into individual components.  Only one component was actually 're-used'.  While in a project this small the level of component breakout could be viewed as excessive, the objective of this exercise was to create components and get the communication working between them.

#### 5-Day Forecast

This project is a fairly straight forward extension of the Social Card project.  Essentially multiple Social Cards are displayed in an unordered list element.

The next order of business for this project would be developing a module to handle API calls to a weather service to retrieve live data.  However, that was beyond the scope I was interested in here.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
